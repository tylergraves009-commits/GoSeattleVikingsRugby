<h2>First find a spot in the forest it can be anyware as long as fits the folowing criteria.</h2>

</ol>
<ol>The shelter we are going to biuld is called a debris hut</ol>
<ol>This works very well for fall camping because three are many debris on the ground</ol>
<ol>When you find your spot clear the are that includes all rocks plants sticks ect.</ol>
<ol>Now that your ground is cleared find a large log that is 10-12 feet long.</ol>
<ol>Find 2 smaller logs and lash them together with paracord.</ol>
<ol>Place the A frame on the spot you cleared</ol>
<ol>Place sticks and logs all the way down the A-Frame</ol>
<ol>Now cover the sticks with smaller sticks with lots of branches</ol>
<ol>Make shure to add some horisantle sticks.</ol>
<ol>Cover the sticks in bark</ol>
<ol>Pile on brush all over the hut.</ol>
<ol>Fill in the rest of the holes with brush.</ol>
<ol>Now on the inside put a bunch of debris and lay in it to create inslation.</ol>



<h2>This is what your hut should look like.</h2>

<h2>Now I will tell you how to filter water.</h2>
<ol>For this you need a filtration method.</ol>
<ol>This can be anything from a life straw to boiling water</ol>
<ol>Now find a sorce of water.</ol>
<ol>It should be clear and running.</ol>
<ol>Now take your pot and put it over you camp stove and boil.</ol>
<h2>You should Get this.</h2>

<h2>Now we will get food.</h2>
<p>Note If you are vegitarian you will not survive because survival is baised on MEAT.</p>
<ol>For today we are going to go fishing.</ol>
<ol>Using 40 lb fishing line from multi-strand paracord, as well as a gorge hook. We would throw out the line with a stick attached loosely.
End of fishing line attached to a small stick where the line is wrapped around to help hold the line
</ol>
<li>Now how the make the gorge hook.</li>
<ol>Whittle a stick to be very short and has two sharp ends.</ol>
<img src="images/gorge_hook.png" width="100">
<ol>This is how the gorge hook works.</ol>
<ol>Fish eats from the narrow way.
Fish swallows. Fisherman pulls on the hook, turning it horizontal in the fish's guts. Hook gets caught, allowing fisherman to reel the fish in.</ol>
<h2>Now how to kill the fish.</h2>
<ol>To kill, insert a knife into a spot directly above between the eyes. </ol>
<ol>To bleed out, place a knife into the gill and snap the veins. </ol>
<ol>To fillet cut from the gill to the tail and remove skin.  </ol>
<ol>Using a camping stove or fire, cook the fish. </ol>
